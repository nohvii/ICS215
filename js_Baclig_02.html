musubi(s). 
<input type="button" id="resetRecipe" value="Reset">
    
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<blockquote>
<input type="number" id="inputCanSpam" value="1" min="0"> (12 ounce) can of SPAM<br>
<input type="number" id="inputNori" value="4" min="0"> 
sheet(s) Nori (8 1/4&quot; x 4&quot;)<br>
<input type="number" id="inputRice" value="6" min="0"> cup(s) cooked rice <br>
</blockquote>
    
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<blockquote>
For this recipe, you will need a musubi mold.<br><br>
Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it).<br>
<br>
Fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness.<br><br>
Cut each sheet of nori in half, length wise. Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your musubi mold across the middle of the nori. Add rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly, so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice. (dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking)  <br><br>
Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori. Add some of the cooked spam to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little package. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</blockquote>
