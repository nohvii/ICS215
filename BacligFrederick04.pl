# Perl Assignment 4
#
# Using regular expression to capture data on a given webpage. The webpage is an archive of the Spring
# 2022 ICS Class Availability webpage. This perl scrip will output the sum total of available seats, 
# across all sections, for a given Leeward ICS course by applying a regex to capture seats available 
#information. When the user runs this script, they will provide a course number as a program argument, 
# the script will then read the webpage, apply a regex, and add up all the seats available for that course
# and output the result.
